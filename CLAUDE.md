# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project

`anchor` — a Brazilian personal-finance app (Flutter 3.32.3 / Dart 3.8.1, Android-only). The user tracks
expenses, the money sources they are paid from, and what is left in each source per month. **UI copy,
enum labels and test names are in pt-BR; code identifiers are in English.** Money is BRL, dates use the
`pt_BR` locale (`initializeDateFormatting('pt_BR')` runs in `main`).

## Commands

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter run
flutter analyze                       # must stay at "No issues found"
dart format lib test
flutter test
flutter test test/app/expense_flow_test.dart
flutter test --plain-name 'nome do teste'
flutter build apk
```

### Android build requires JDK 21

Gradle 8.12 cannot parse the Java 25 runtime that `flutter doctor` picks up from Android Studio, and the
build fails with a bare `* What went wrong: 25.0.2`. Fix it once, at user level (not in the repo):

```bash
flutter config --jdk-dir=/usr/lib/jvm/java-21-openjdk-amd64
```

Never commit `org.gradle.java.home` into `android/gradle.properties` — it is machine-specific.

## Architecture

MVVM, feature-first. Each feature owns `models/`, `repositories/`, `viewmodels/`, `views/` (+ `views/widgets/`).
Wiring is `provider`; persistence is `sqflite`.

### The two cross-cutting pieces

- **`features/budget/`** is not a screen. It is the aggregation layer every other feature reads:
  `BudgetService.loadSnapshot(month)` reads all four repositories and returns a `BudgetSnapshot`
  (`MonthSummary` + `WalletSummary` per wallet + raw lists). Dashboard, Expenses and Wallets all render
  from a snapshot, so **totals are computed in one place** — add derived numbers to `MonthSummary`/
  `WalletSummary`, never in a view.
- **`core/state/`** holds the two notifiers shared by all view models: `DataChanges` (repositories call
  `publish()` after every write) and `MonthSelection` (the month the whole app is showing).
  `ReactiveViewModel` subscribes to `DataChanges` and re-runs `loadData()`, which is why a write in one
  tab refreshes the others with no manual plumbing.

`loadSnapshot` also calls `registerDuePayouts` — this is what "the app credits your salary on payday"
means in practice. Several view models load concurrently, so that insert uses
`ConflictAlgorithm.ignore` against the `(payout_id, month_key)` unique index; keep it idempotent.

### Domain model

An **expense** is a rule, not a row per month. `Expense.occurrenceIn(Month)` projects it into an
`ExpenseOccurrence` (or null):

| `ExpenseType` | pt-BR label | rule |
|---|---|---|
| `recurring` | Recorrente | every month from `startMonth` until `endMonth` (null = forever) |
| `installment` | Parcelada | `settledInstallments + monthsSince(startMonth) + 1`, while ≤ `totalInstallments` |
| `single` | Avulsa | only `startMonth` |

`settledInstallments` is what makes "12x, 5 already paid" work: `startMonth` is the month of the *next*
unpaid parcel, so the projection resumes at number 6 and stops after 12. Payments are stored separately
(`expense_payments`, one row per expense per month), so marking a month paid never mutates the rule.

A **wallet** (`features/wallets/`) is a money source — salary or a benefit (VR/VA/mercado). It owns
`payouts` (recurring "day 5, R$ X" entries — this is the flexible calendar) which generate `receipts`
(actual credits). A wallet's balance is *all* receipts minus *all* payments charged to it, so it carries
across months; the month figures on `WalletSummary` are separate.

`Month` (`core/utils/month.dart`) is the value object used everywhere instead of `DateTime` — it has
comparison operators, `monthsSince`, and `dayOf` (clamps day 31 to the real month length).

## Testing

`test/support/test_database.dart` gives repositories a real in-memory SQLite via
`sqflite_common_ffi`. Two details are load-bearing: it uses `databaseFactoryFfiNoIsolate` (the override
below does not cross isolates) and it opens `libsqlite3.so.0` explicitly, because this machine has no
`libsqlite3.so` symlink.

`test/app/` boots the whole app with `AnchorApp(database: …)` against that database. When adding
widget tests: scope `find.byType(TextField)` to the sheet/page you mean (a sheet does not hide the form
behind it), scope tab taps to `NavigationBar` (feature icons collide with destination icons), and use the
concrete generic (`DropdownButtonFormField<ExpenseType>`).

## Conventions

- Clean Code: few comments, names that explain themselves.
- Theme lives in `app/theme/`; the palette is green tones (`AppPalette`) and the app must work in
  light, dark and system mode (`SettingsViewModel` persists the choice).
- Every `FloatingActionButton` needs an explicit `heroTag` — pages stay alive in an `IndexedStack`.
- Do not add `Co-Authored-By` trailers to commits.

## Git

The git repository is rooted at `/home/vinicius` (the user's home), not at this project, and it tracks a
different app (`AndroidStudioProjects/projeto_legal`). Always scope git commands to explicit paths;
never `git add -A` or `git add .` from here.
